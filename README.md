"# covid19-analysis-by---ML" 

## Overview

A comprehensive machine learning analysis of COVID-19 pandemic data, combining confirmed cases, deaths, and happiness metrics to uncover patterns and trends across global populations.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration**: Combines COVID-19 confirmed cases, death statistics, and worldwide happiness index
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth statistical analysis and visualization of pandemic trends
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive modeling using various ML algorithms
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Correlates pandemic impact with global happiness metrics
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Clear and insightful charts for trend identification

## Dataset Information

This project uses three primary datasets:

1. **covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv**: Global COVID-19 confirmed cases by country and date
2. **covid19_deaths_dataset.csv**: COVID-19 death statistics by country and date
3. **worldwide_happiness_report.csv**: World Happiness Index metrics for correlation analysis

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis environment
